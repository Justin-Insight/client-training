## Special Considerations

### Image Handling

All images throughout the website are configured and served through an image transformation service called [Imgix](https://imgix.com/). Imgix automatically handles all images that are uploaded to the website, resizes them and transforms them into modern image formats like AVIF and WEBP.

### Uploading Images

<div class="warning">
<div class="warning__svg-wrapper">
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>ionicons-v5-r</title><path d="M85.57,446.25H426.43a32,32,0,0,0,28.17-47.17L284.18,82.58c-12.09-22.44-44.27-22.44-56.36,0L57.4,399.08A32,32,0,0,0,85.57,446.25Z" style="fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:32px"/><path d="M250.26,195.39l5.74,122,5.73-121.95a5.74,5.74,0,0,0-5.79-6h0A5.74,5.74,0,0,0,250.26,195.39Z" style="fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:32px"/><path d="M256,397.25a20,20,0,1,1,20-20A20,20,0,0,1,256,397.25Z"/></svg>

<h4>Important!</h4>

You will never need to upload a full-resolution image to your website. Images are the most resource-intensive form of media that your website will load. Loading full-size images will negatively affect the performance of your website and will hurt your search rankings. If you're unsure how to handle images for the web, please reach out to <a href="https://insightcreative.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external">Insight Creative, Inc.</a> for assistance.

To optimize an image: make sure to primarily use .jpg image files. .png files save a lot more image data and can easily make an identical image four times the file size of a .jpg. If you are using an image editor like Photoshop, you will have image options when you save. Save as the lowest quality you can before your image starts to look bad (usually 80% quality). You should almost always shoot for under 300kb file size for all images you load to the website. When done right, it’s rare that the loss of image quality will be noticeable.

After you save your image, the front end of the website will automatically optimize and transform your image into a more modern and performant image. This ensures your images are loading as fast as possible.
