## Admin Dashboard Overview

### Home

Home is where you can find your Live URL, a preview of your website, documentation, and a list of recent activity.

### Inboxes

See your form notifications, check spam, resend notification emails and export contacts to a spreadsheet.

### Pages

Here you will find a list of all your website pages. Pages are broken out by their section rather than being one large group.

## Editing Basic Website Information

### Managing Business Info

1. Navigate to Data > Site Settings.
2. Here you can edit your business name, address, phone, fax, email and social media links.
3. As soon as you make a change, you will see the save button in the top right corner activate. Click "Save" to publish your changes to the website, or continue to other pages that you need to edit. Alternatively, your changes will be bulk saved and you can publish all changes together.

## Managing Pages

1. Navigate to Pages. Here you will see a list of all your website's pages. Select the page you are looking for by clicking on the preview image of the page. You can also open the editor by clicking the three vertical dots in the top right corner and then selecting your options.
2. **Note:** To open the visual editor, if not already open by default, click the three vertical dots and choose, "Open With >" and then select "Visual Editor.” If already in the editor, open the dropdown menu in the top left corner and select visual editor.
3. Once the editor is open you will see a similar content structure for all pages. All primary pages will contain a Title, SEO metadata, followed by all content blocks the page uses. 
4. To edit a content block, click on the content block field, this will open all the fields contained within the block. Once you are done making your changes, click "Save" in the top right corner, or continue to other pages that you need to edit. Your changes will be bulk saved and you can publish all changes together.

## Editing Basic SEO Information

If you ever feel the need to edit SEO metadata for your website, SEO settings can be found on each individual page. Navigate to the page you want to edit and click open the "SEO" content block. Here you will find Page Title, Meta Description, and Featured Image for your page.

## Special Considerations

### Uploading Images

<div class="warning">
<div class="warning__svg-wrapper">
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>ionicons-v5-r</title><path d="M85.57,446.25H426.43a32,32,0,0,0,28.17-47.17L284.18,82.58c-12.09-22.44-44.27-22.44-56.36,0L57.4,399.08A32,32,0,0,0,85.57,446.25Z" style="fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:32px"/><path d="M250.26,195.39l5.74,122,5.73-121.95a5.74,5.74,0,0,0-5.79-6h0A5.74,5.74,0,0,0,250.26,195.39Z" style="fill:none;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:32px"/><path d="M256,397.25a20,20,0,1,1,20-20A20,20,0,0,1,256,397.25Z"/></svg>

<h4>Important!</h4>

You will never need to upload a full-resolution image to your website. Images are the most resource-intensive form of media that your website will load. Loading full-size images will negatively affect the performance of your website and will hurt your search rankings. If you're unsure how to handle images for the web, please reach out to <a href="https://insightcreative.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external">Insight Creative, Inc.</a> for assistance.

To optimize an image: make sure to primarily use .jpg image files. .png files save a lot more image data and can easily make an identical image four times the file size of a .jpg. If you are using an image editor like Photoshop, you will have image options when you save. Save as the lowest quality you can before your image starts to look bad (usually 80% quality). You should almost always shoot for under 300kb file size for all images you load to the website. When done right, it’s rare that the loss of image quality will be noticeable.

After you save your image, the front end of the website will automatically optimize and transform your image into a more modern and performant image. This ensures your images are loading as fast as possible.
