## Admin Dashboard Overview

Your site uses Netlify CMS for a backend Content Management System. Netlify CMS focuses on only the items you need and cuts out everything unnecessary. Your content is stored and can be found in Collections.

### Collections

Collections are the groupings of editable content for your website. This site consists of Site Info and Pages.

## Managing Content

### Editing Basic Business Information

To edit content such as business name, phone number and hours:

1. Navigate to Site Info > Business Info.
2. Here you'll find options to edit business name, phone number, email adress, address, and hours. Make your desired change as needed and click Publish in the top right corner when you're ready to save and publish your change.

### Editing Pages

1. Click on Pages in the Collections menu. Here you'll see a list of all your site's pages.
2. Click on the page that you're needing to edit. Pages are broken out into three core sections, Page Title, SEO, and Page Content.
   1. Page Title. This is your pages primary title.
   2. SEO. SEO contains your SEO Title, Description, and Featured Image. The SEO Title is the page title that gets used by search engines, not a front facing page title. Description is the meta description that gets used by search engines. Featured Image is an image that you can select that will be used as a featured image for social sharing. Note: this image doesn't actually get used on your website, only as a preview image when the site gets shared on social media.
   3. Page Content. While this isn't neccessarily labeled as such, the remaining fields are all your actual page content. Content is structured in the same order it is displayed on your page.
3. When ready to publish, simply click the Publish button in the top right corner.

## Special Considerations

Your new site does all the work up front to prepare files for your site visitors so pages can be delivered much faster. After editing a page's content, sit back and enjoy some coffee and give it a minute to rebuild your site and then go view your newly published change on the front-end of your site.

**_Pro Tip:_** If planning to make multiple changes to your content at the same time, plan to make your easy changes first (e.g. An edit to an existing page). While your site rebuilds, you can then tackle your larger change (e.g. writing a new employee bio). This leads to an editing process that still feels productive and reduces waiting times.
